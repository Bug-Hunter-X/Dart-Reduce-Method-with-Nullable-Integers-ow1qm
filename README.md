# Dart Reduce Method with Nullable Integers

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` method in Dart with lists containing nullable integers. The issue arises from attempting to directly add nullable integers without handling potential null values.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides the corrected version.

## Problem
The `reduce` method requires a function that takes two arguments of the same type and returns a value of that type. When using nullable integers (`int?`), the function must handle null values to prevent errors.

## Solution
The solution involves using the null-aware operators (`??`) or a conditional expression to handle null values gracefully.  This ensures the `reduce` method functions correctly even when dealing with lists that may contain nulls.
